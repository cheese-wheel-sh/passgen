# Passgen Project by itsthooor
Hey and welcome to my GUI version of the password generator (https://github.com/itsthooor/Password-Generator).
To this version i added a great ui, a new algorythm, a help as well as about page.
Some features (like a set of own chosen characters) are still in planning / developement.
I will update this project more often than the command line based one, but the command line based one will get an cleaner update in the future and it will be added to this repository as well, making my github much cleaner.

I'm still new to github so please don't be angry, if i do something wrong here ^^
I'm available for any questions or issues :)

# Why Passgen and not any other program / website
Simple: It's all about the safemode algorythm implemented inside Passgen.
It tries to make passwords more secure and it does a great job at it (see https://github.com/itsthooor/passgen#recommended-password-length-with-passgen).
It will also see many updates to make it more and more secure.
Also you don't have to fire up a website for password generation (then there's still the competition with other programs).

# Recommended Password Length with Passgen
I testest the algorythm many times and it will be updated often to ensure security by it.
I use http://www.passwordmeter.com/ for password score and let my Passgen compete against https://passwordsgenerator.net/ and https://duckduckgo.com.
Passgen got always the best result at 50 or less for now (i tested 100, 50 and 30).
passwordsgenerator had 50-100 more points on a length of 100, but this will be changed in future updates ;)
Update: Algorythm is  now more in testing than before, but works better than before.
But you don't have to use it, if you don't want to. It seems still to be better than other generators.

# BEFORE DOWNLOADING
Please go to the releases, because the Help.py needs a JPG file which is inside a bin folder. If you can live without that JPG or wanna figure everything out byy yourself, then you're able to download the zip right away ^^
If not, then please head to the releases and choose the package of your liking :)

I want to talk about this as openly as i can, to ensure you know everything before trying it out ^^
If you have anny suggestions please feel free to contact me :)
See you and have fun with my project :D
