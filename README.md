# Passgen Project by itsthooor
Hey and welcome to my GUI version of the password generator (https://github.com/itsthooor/Password-Generator).
To this version i added a great ui, a new algorythm, a help as well as about page.
Some features (like a set of own chosen characters) are still in planning / developement.
I will update this project more often than the command line based one, but the command line based one will get an cleaner update in the future and it will be added to this repository as well, making my github much cleaner.

I'm still new to github so please don't be angry, if i do something wrong here ^^
I'm available for any questions or issues :)

# PLEASE UPGRADE TO 0.4 OR HIGHER
There is a mess up on my side at version 0.3 and less.
I used random() to create the passwords, but this isn't secure at all and so i got recommended to use secrets() instead, because it's also made for password generation. Version 0.4 and hiher have these implemented and so please upgrade as soon as possible!

# Why Passgen?
Simple: It's all about the safemode algorythm implemented inside Passgen.
It tries to make passwords more secure and it does a great job at it (see https://github.com/itsthooor/passgen#recommended-password-length-with-passgen).
It will also see many updates to make it more and more secure.
Also you don't have to fire up a website for password generation (then there's still the competition with other programs).
With Version 0.4 and higher Passgen got very fast at generating and is therefore better than ever before.

# Recommended Password Length with Passgen
I testest the algorythm many times and it will be updated often to ensure security by it.
I use http://www.passwordmeter.com/ for password score and let my Passgen compete against https://passwordsgenerator.net/ and https://duckduckgo.com.
Passgen got always the best result at 50 or less for now (i tested 100, 50 and 30).
passwordsgenerator had 50-100 more points on a length of 100, but this will be changed in future updates ;)
Update: Algorythm is  now more in testing than before, but works better than before.
But you don't have to use it, if you don't want to. It seems still to be better than other generators.
Edit:
With Version 0.4 and higher you should be able to get better results at lower and higher numbers.

I want to talk about this as openly as i can, to ensure you know everything before trying it out ^^
If you have anny suggestions please feel free to contact me :)
See you and have fun with my project :D
