# Welcome to Passgen

### Passgen Project Overview
Welcome to my Passgen Project Website. This is just a Website for the Passgen Project, so anyone can have a better overview and is able to download much faster.
Other Stuff is on the Github Page.
Maybe i'll also post Updates, Ideas, Polls etc, but those are already planned on my [Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/itsthooor).

### Features
It comes with simple Features like password length, copy-to-clipboard button, password strength, a simple help documentation, a short about message, generation stats and the best thing: the [safemode algorithm](https://itsthooor.github.io/passgen#why-passgen).

### Why Passgen?
Simple: It's all about the safemode algorythm implemented inside Passgen. It tries to make passwords more secure and it does a great job at it (see [here](https://github.com/itsthooor/passgen#recommended-password-length-with-passgen)). It will also see many updates to make it more and more secure. Also you don't have to fire up a website for password generation (then there's still the competition with other programs). With Version 0.4 and higher Passgen got very fast at generating and is therefore better than ever before.
